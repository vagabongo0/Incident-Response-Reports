# Incident Response Reports  

## 🎯 Objective  
Document and analyse simulated cybersecurity incidents as part of my SOC Analyst learning path (Hack The Box, TryHackMe, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel).  

These reports demonstrate the ability to:  
- Identify, triage, and respond to security incidents  
- Perform log analysis and evidence collection  
- Communicate technical findings clearly  

---

## 📚 Example Scenarios  
1. **Phishing Attack** – Investigation of a malicious email, header analysis, and IOCs extraction.  
2. **Ransomware Simulation** – Detection of suspicious encryption activity, isolation, and remediation steps.  
3. **Brute Force Attempt** – Alert triage, investigation, and account recovery actions.

## 📁 Structure  
Each report is written in Markdown and follows a standard IR format:  

```
Incident-Response-Reports/
│
└── reports/
    ├── phishing_attack_report.md
    ├── ransomware_simulation_report.md
```

## 🧩 Report Format  
Each report includes:  
- **Summary**  
- **Incident Timeline**  
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**  
- **Analysis & Evidence**  
- **Containment, Eradication & Recovery**  
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**  
- **Lessons Learned**

## 🧰 Tools Used  
- Microsoft Sentinel  
- Splunk Enterprise  
- Wireshark  
- CyberChef  
- Windows Event Viewer

## 🏁 Goal  
Showcase practical SOC and IR skills — not just theory.  

Each report is based on hands-on lab work, simulated environments, or open training data.
